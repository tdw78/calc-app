This project is a calculator app.  The calculator allows users to perform basic mathematics.  The app was bootstrapped with Create React App.

To view the app, navigate to the project's root directory, and run the "npm start" command and the app will open at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

I added a hover feature to the app.  When a user hovers over one of the calculator's buttons, that button's background color will change.
